    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2 id="bold">Video Games:</h2>
<p>One of my favourite hobbies is playing video games. I grew up playing on an Xbox 360 and Xbox One, I bought a PlayStation 5 last year and have been playing on that since. My favourite Games are;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dark Souls</li>
  <li>Skyrim</li>
  <li>Modern Warfare II</li>
</ol>  

<h2 id="bold">Movies:</h2>
<p>I also enjoy watching movies. Its a great way to pass the time. I would find it impossible to pick a single favourite movie out the countless ones out there but here are some of my favourites in no particular order; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Airplane! (1980)</li>
  <li>Interstellar (2014)</li>
  <li>The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) </li>
</ul>
